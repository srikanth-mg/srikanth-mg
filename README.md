# Hi, I'm Srikanth Muthuvel Ganthimathi

**Aspiring Silicon Design Engineer** | RTL • ASIC • GPU • CPU • SoC • RISC-V • Microarchitecture

I’m a Master’s student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Binghamton University, focusing on front-end ASIC & Digital design, RTL development, and CPU/GPU microarchitecture.
I currently work as a Digital Design Engineer Intern at Western Semiconductor, contributing to RISC-V SoC architecture, cache subsystems, vector execution logic, and verification workflows.

My work spans from microarchitecture → RTL → simulation → timing analysis → FPGA prototyping, giving me full-stack understanding of digital IC design flows.
